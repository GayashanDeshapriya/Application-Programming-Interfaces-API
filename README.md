# Application-Programming-Interfaces-(API)
### What is API:
- An Application Programming Interface (API) is a contract that allows code to talk to other code. APIs are the building blocks of modern software because they allow for sharing of resources and services across applications, organizations, and devices.

### Why are APIs important?
- APIs help developers integrate exciting features and build automation without reinventing the wheel
ex: using a Weather API instead of launching your weather balloons

- APIs allow enterprises to open up their product for faster innovation
ex: apps that interact with Twitter or Meta APIs by posting on your behalf or reading tweets

- APIs can be products themselves
ex: Software as a Service (SaaS) products like Stripe's payment APIs or Twilio's text messaging and email APIs

### Type of API s
  #### Hardware APIs
  - Interface for software to talk to hardware.
    Example: How your phone's camera talks to the operating system.

#### Software Library APIs
  - Interface for directly consuming code from another code base.
    Example: Using methods from a library you import into your application.

#### Web APIs
  - Interface for communicating across code bases over a network.
    Example: Fetching current stock prices from a finance API over the internet.

##### Some of the API 
  - REST (Representational State Transfer)
  - GraphQL
  - WebSockets
  - webhooks
  - SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
  - gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)
  - MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport)

#### Access
 - APIs also vary in the scope of who can access them.

    ##### Public APIs (aka Open APIs)
    - Consumed by anyone who discovers the API

    ##### Private APIs
    - Consumed only within an organization and not made public

    ##### Partner APIs
    - Consumed between one or more organizations that have an established relationship

```javascript
// Which came first: the chicken or the egg?
console.log(['ü•ö', 'üê£', 'üê•', 'üêî'].sort())

>>> [ 'üêî', 'üê£', 'üê•', 'ü•ö' ]
```
